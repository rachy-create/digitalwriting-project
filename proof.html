Mine is the urine that stains the stick. It’s winter and it’s freezing in our tumbledown sharehouse and the girls natter through chattering teeth to take my mind off the egg timer’s tick-tick-tick. It was their idea that I take the test. I don’t think I’m pregnant, not really, not if modern medicine has any say in the matter. But modern medicine has failed us before, us three specifically, so here we are in our shared winter coats sharing stories of missed periods and shitty ex-boyfriends while the egg timer counts three minutes. 

I didn’t know these girls three months ago. I don’t know yet I won’t know them a year from now, though in the meantime we’ll wipe each other’s tears and sleep in each other’s beds and call each other sisters. Then in three years I’ll bump into one of them at the pub and she’ll show off her engagement ring and my whole chest will ache. I don’t know that yet. 

The egg timer rings. I almost forgot about it; too busy feeling lucky. I’m so far from home and comfort and family and central heating and stovetops that light without matches, but I’ve found two girls who’ll pick up a stick with my pee on it to tell me if life as I know it is over and pour me a glass of $3 Aldi wine when it’s not. 

Our phone-stealing fourth roommate comes home. “No baby!” they tell him and he cheers, fixing himself a Frangelico and milk to join the celebrations. I feel very grown up.

And I did. 
You told me so in that same bed three months later. And it was the first time a man had ever said those words to me. 
I remember anticipating it, watching the words tumble out of your mouth with a sheepish, self-conscious little smile. You looked up at me for reassurance. 
So I gave it to you. 
“I love you, too.”
I didn’t, not right in that moment, but what’s a girl to do when she hears something like that for the first time in her young life from a beautiful man with a gorgeous smile who calls her Sunflower and writes songs about her? She says it back, and hopes it comes true. 
It did. 
We were driving along the Great Ocean Road, on our way to spend a weekend with your family, and you were singing along to British India, ‘I Can Make You Love Me’. God I loved to watch you sing. God I //loved// you. 
Part of me wished I’d waited, because when I said “I love you” as you finished off the chorus you didn’t realise it was different. You didn’t realise part of my soul had escaped through my lips and was yours now, in a way it had never been before. But that’s okay, because you smiled just as sweetly nonetheless and we kept driving, a girl and her first love.

It is your second heartbreak, seven years after the first. It is my first. 
Because it is my first, I don’t know what to do, or maybe that has nothing to do with it because you look just as lost as I. I don’t know. I’ve never done this before. 
There are so many tears, so much snot. No more shouting, for once. 
I will fly home tomorrow for a week and we won’t talk but I’ll write you letters every night, letters I’ll never show you, letters I won’t even read for another couple years by which point I will have cried over at least three new men, but my heart will still ache with each line. Lines such as: 
* We’re not together but there’s an asterisk.
* Well, there’s far too much under the rug for us to keep ignoring it. 
* I really believe you’re the type of man I want to end up with, I’m just nowhere near that woman yet. 
We will break up another thousand times before it sticks, never getting back together but perpetually breaking up. There will be countless drunk calls and nights when we crawl into the other’s bed, then sneak out in the morning laden with regret. There will be months of no contact, “it’s easier this way”, then suddenly it’s my birthday or I see something only you would get and we’re talking again, all day every day, until it ends in tears. And repeat.
It is a tale as old as time. But how am I to know? I’ve never done this before.
